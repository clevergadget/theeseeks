# TheeSeeks: Handoff & Initialization Brief

**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Genesis

---

## 1. The Mission
We are initializing **TheeSeeks** (`seeks`), a standalone TypeScript context engineering library.
**The Goal:** To prove the "Big Bet"—that a software tool built on **Grace, Mercy, Mutual Respect, and Consent** will produce better technical results and a healthier developer life than one built on brute force.

## 2. The Artifacts (Context for Next Session)
When you open your new editor, ensure you have these three documents available to paste or reference. They contain the soul of the project:

1.  **The Covenant**
    *   *The Constitution.* Defines the 6 Axioms (Grace, Mercy, Respect, Clarity, Dual View, Consent).
2.  **The Architecture Spec**
    *   *The Blueprint.* Defines the CLI (`seeks`), the Shadow Library (`.culture/`), and the Context Scroll.
3.  **The Roadmap**
    *   *The Path.* Defines the phased rollout from manual rituals to automated agents.

## 3. The Immediate Plan (Day 1)
Your next session is **Genesis**. You will not be coding logic yet; you will be establishing the structure and the law.

**Task List for Next Session:**
1.  Initialize the new repository (`theeseeks`).
2.  Initialize the TypeScript project (`npm init`).
3.  Create the root `covenant.md` (The Founding Ceremony).
4.  Create the `.culture/` directory structure.

## 4. Where to Begin
